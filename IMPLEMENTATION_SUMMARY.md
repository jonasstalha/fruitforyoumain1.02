## Data Structure

### MultiLot Interface
```typescript
interface MultiLot {
  id: string;
  lotNumber: string;
  status: 'draft' | 'in-progress' | 'completed' | 'archived';
  currentStep: number;
  completedSteps: number[];
  assignedUsers: string[];
  globallyAccessible: boolean;
  createdBy: string;
  createdAt: string;
  updatedAt: string;
  completedAt?: string;
  
  // All 7 tracking steps
  harvest: { ... };
  transport: { ... };
  sorting: { ... };
  packaging: { ... };
  storage: { ... };
  export: { ... };
  delivery: { ... };
}
```

## Workflow

### Creating a New Lot
1. User navigates to New Entry page
2. Lot selector appears first
3. User clicks "Nouveau lot"
4. Form initializes with empty data
5. User fills in harvest information
6. Lot is saved as draft in Firebase

### Working on Existing Lots
1. User navigates to New Entry page
2. Lot selector shows available lots
3. User selects an existing lot
4. Form loads with current lot data
5. User continues from current step
6. Progress is automatically saved

### Completing Lots
1. When all 7 steps are completed
2. Lot status changes to "completed"
3. Lot is removed from active new entry selector
4. Lot remains visible in lots management page
5. Can be manually archived

### Archive Management
1. Completed lots can be archived
2. Archived lots move to "Archives" tab
3. Archives remain accessible for reference
4. Archive action available in dropdown menu

## Technical Implementation

### Firebase Integration
- Real-time synchronization using Firestore subscriptions
- Optimistic updates for better UX
- Proper error handling and retry logic
- Security rules validation

### State Management
- React hooks for local state
- Firebase subscriptions for global state
- Efficient re-rendering with proper dependencies
- Loading and error states

### Performance Optimizations
- Filtered queries for active vs archived lots
- Efficient data fetching strategies
- Minimal re-renders through proper memoization
- Background auto-save functionality

## User Experience Features

### Global Accessibility
- All lots are globally accessible by default
- Real-time collaboration support
- User assignment tracking
- Cross-account lot sharing

### Archive System
- Clean separation of active vs completed lots
- Historical data preservation
- Easy archive management
- Search functionality across all tabs

### Progress Tracking
- Visual progress indicators
- Step completion tracking
- Status badges and icons
- Real-time updates

## Deployment
- Firestore rules successfully deployed
- Application running on localhost:5174
- No breaking changes to existing functionality
- Backward compatibility with legacy lots
